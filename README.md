# -Customer-Churn-Prediction-Revenue-Risk-Intelligence
An end-to-end data &amp; machine learning solution that identifies at-risk customers, predicts churn, and quantifies revenue loss so businesses can take action before it’s too late.

🚀 Why This Project Exists

Every company loses customers — but most don’t know who is about to leave or how much money is at risk.

This project answers three critical business questions:

Question	Business Value
Who is disengaged?	Identify customers at risk
Who will churn next?	Predict churn using ML
How much revenue is at risk?	Enable smart retention spending
🧠 What This System Does

This is not just a model — it’s a decision engine.

🔍 Step 1 — Find At-Risk Customers (SQL)

We identify customers who show churn signals, such as:

No purchase in 90+ days

Declining order frequency

Falling average spend

These customers become the ML prediction pool.

🤖 Step 2 — Predict Churn (Python ML)

A classification model is trained using:

Days since last purchase

Purchase frequency

Average order value

Total spend

Each customer receives a Churn Probability Score:

Customer	Churn Risk
John Smith	87%
Emily Johnson	65%
Patrick Hep	60%

This lets the business know who is about to leave before they do.

💰 Step 3 — Calculate Revenue at Risk (Excel)

We translate churn into money:

Revenue at Risk = Customer Spend × Churn Probability


This shows:

How much revenue is exposed

Which customers matter most financially

Where retention efforts should be focused

📊 Step 4 — Tableau Executive Dashboard

The dashboard provides leadership with:

📉 Total inactive customers

⚠️ High / Medium / Low risk segments

💵 Revenue at risk

🧑‍💼 Individual customer risk table

📈 Customer activity trends

Executives can instantly see:

“If we save just 10% of these customers, how much money do we keep?”

🏆 Business Impact
Metric	Value
Inactive Customers Detected	1,245
Predicted Churn Rate	28.4%
Monthly Revenue at Risk	$85,000
Annual Revenue Exposure	$1,020,000

This is the difference between:

Reacting to churn

Preventing churn before it happens
